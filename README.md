# PRODIGY_WD_01
Cold Cream is a high-performance, responsive landing page built for a luxury ice cream brand. By moving away from typical "bright and bubbly" dessert aesthetics, this project adopts a sophisticated Espresso, Amber, and Cream visual language to position the brand as an artisanal, high-end experience.


🎯 Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a digital storefront that is both visually appealing and technically sound. I focused on clean code, smooth user interactions, and a "Mobile-First" approach to ensure the website looks great on every device, from high-resolution monitors to small smartphones.


🚀 Key Features in Detail
1. Interactive Navigation Bar
Transparent to Solid Transition: The navbar starts transparent to highlight the hero image but changes to a solid deep-brown background as the user scrolls.
Hover Animations: Navigation links feature a "sliding underline" effect to guide the user's focus.
Mobile Hamburger Menu: A custom-built menu toggle for mobile users that slides out smoothly from the side.


3. High-Impact Hero Section
Full-Screen Display: Uses the 100vh property to fill the entire screen on load.
Visual Clarity: A dark-gradient overlay is applied to the background image to ensure the white text and Call-To-Action (CTA) button are always easy to read.


3. Responsive Menu & Pricing
CSS Grid Layout: A fluid grid that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on the screen size.
Product Cards: Each ice cream flavor (Mango, Vanilla, Blueberry, etc.) is housed in a card that "lifts" up and gains a shadow when hovered.
Localized Context: Prices are displayed in Rupees (₹) to suit the local market.


5. Interactive Visual Gallery
Immersive Grid: A dedicated section to showcase high-quality photos of the parlor's offerings.
Smooth Zoom Effect: Images scale up slightly on hover without breaking the layout, adding a layer of polish to the user experience.
